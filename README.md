## So what is this?

If you have played the word puzzle game [Wordsmyth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordsmyth-a-daily-word-game/id1534959553) ([@WordsmythApp](https://twitter.com/WordsmythApp)) you know that some times getting all the words is pretty tough, even when using the built-in hints feature. This app makes ~~cheating~~ solving the game easier by finding all the possible words that can be made with the given grid.

## Why did you make this?

More than anything, for fun. It was a nice holiday project to get away of the routine. ~~But also to win the game.~~

## How did you make it?

SwiftUI! It was pretty fun, although I had to use a couple hacks here and there.

## How do I use it?

1. First, you need to get the app. There are a few ways to do it.
    - ~~The simplest way is to download the app from this link (macOS only)~~ -> (comingsoon™)
    - ~~Alternatively, you can find it in Testflight (iOS and macOS)~~ -> (comingsoon™)
    - Or you can get this repo and build the app yourself with Xcode 🤷🏽‍♂️
2. Input the letters into the grid.
3. Click the `[A]` looking button to genereate the words.
4. Find the words for the length you need.
5. ~~Mark the words that you found / the game missed~~ -> (comingsoon™)
